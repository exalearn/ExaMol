# Redoxmer Design Example

This example shows how to use ExaMol to find molecules with optimized redox potentials.
For simplicity, we use [MOPAC](http://openmopac.net/) to compute the redox potentials
so that this whole example can run on a laptop.

## Running the example

Navigate to this directory and then call

```
examol run spec.py:spec
```

It will output to `run` and eventually produce a file, `report.md`, that contains a summary of run.
