# Seed the Information Needed for Absorption Computations

The following directories are used to prepare for surface energy computations.

1. _Optional_: Verify that CP2K is using converged parameters for our target surfaces.
    - _TBD_: Update the documentation on using CP2K with PBE.
2. Generate then relax the surfaces.
3. Compute surface adsorption for certain species.
